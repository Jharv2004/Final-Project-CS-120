# Final-Project-CS-120

I couldn't figure out the visuals, so I made a text based version.

My project goals: Make a game that works before the deadline.

During this project, I learned that visuals are had to code in. I was getting stuck on how to incorporate visuals within my code. I would like to improve my coding skills in general so I don't has as much limitations as I thought I did. I would not prosrastinate the project as much as I did for this project. If I started earlier with a good idea, I would of had more time to work ojn the project. I had to stray away from my game document completely since I could not figure out the visuals. I mostly stayed on track with the type of game I wanted to do, which I did a bunch of research on how to code the game in python without learning a new type of python.
